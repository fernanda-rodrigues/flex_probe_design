# flex_probe_design

Repository storing code for the design of custom Flex Short Gapfill probes.
Design follows recommendations from 10x genomics, as described below:

- GC content should be between 44 âˆ’ 72% for each 25 bp probe half.
- Avoid homopolymer repeats.
- Avoid overlap with annotated repeat or low complexity sequences.
- If possible, design probes for coding regions of mRNA as opposed to untranslated regions.
